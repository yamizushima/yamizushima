- 👋 Hi, I’m Yuji Mizushima and a First-year PhD student in Policy Analysis at the Frederick S. Pardee Rand Graduate School. I also serve as an Assistant Policy Researcher at the RAND Corporation. 
- 👀 My primmary interests are in health, labor, and pubic economics. 
- 🌱 I am currently learning advanced microeconometric analysis, double/debiased machine learning, operations research, and cost-effective RCT's. I aim to apply both economic theory and empirical microeconomics in my research. I also aspire to hone my skills in empirical welfare maximization. 
- 💞️ I strive to combine academia-industry-informtaion technology, such as software engineering and interactive tool development. Furthermore, I am open to collaborting with local communities to develop and apply methods for creating natural experiments to improve the rigor and objectivity of public policy when ethical constraints for RCT's exist. 
- 📫 Please feel free to reach me at yujij8[at]gmail.com.
